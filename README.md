# Planning

- As part of learning FastHTML, I wanted to build an app to check my deployments, with similar functionality to this [deployments dashboard](https://jamesdiffeycoding-pythonlivedashboard.vercel.app/).

# Building

# Debugging

## Getting Started

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Locally

Start the development server on http://0.0.0.0:5001

```bash
python main.py
```

When you make changes to your project, the server will automatically reload.

## Deploying to Vercel

Deploy your project to Vercel with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

Or `git push` to your repostory with our [git integration](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git).
